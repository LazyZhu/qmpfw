[qmpfw]

Qmpfw is a tool for developers to create a development enviroment for qMp.
Basically it consists in one Makefile, so it is called using "make" command.

Read Only URL: http://qmp.cat/git/qmpfw.git
Developer URL: ssh://gitosis@qmp.cat:221/qmpfw.git

*Directory structure

There are several directories and files. This is the functionallity for each of them:

    Makefile: the main makefile

    targets.mk: file which contains all information related with targets. If you want to add a new supported device you must edit it

    build: here you will have all needed sources

    build/configs: if you do some change in config file using "menuconfig" option, the new config is placed here (and also in destination target)

    dl: download folder for OpenWRT packages

    configs: config files for each kind of hardware. These are the default ones provided by qmpfw

    images: output directory for compiled images, each of them has a different timestamp, so you can have as many as you want

*Command options

To compile a qMp image from scratch, you need to specify the target (next example with target=rspro):
This command will run all necessary commands to compile the image. After the compilation you can see the OpenWRT code in directory: build/[target]

    make T=rspro build

Also you can specify the number of parallel processes for compilation and the verbose level:

    make V=99 J=2 T=rspro build

To see list of avaiable targets run:

    make list_targets

This will update all targets

    make update
    (this will update only qmp source)

This will update only rspro target

    make T=rspro update

This will update all sources (qmp, openwrt feeds and eighennet)

    make update_all

To run menuconfig (from openwrt):

    make T=rspro menuconfig

After that, the new config file will be applied to destination target and also it will by copied inside build/configs directory
To run kernel menuconfig (from openwrt):

    make T=rspro kernel_menuconfig

To run the initial checkout:

    make T=rspro checkout

To clean specific target:

    make T=rspro clean

To clean all targets:

    make clean

To clean just qmp packages from a target

    make T=rspro clean_qmp

To configure some general parameters from qMp you can run:

    make config
